## Exploratory data analysis

Track the impact of living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their academic performance in mathematics, in order to identify students at risk at an early stage. Conduct a reconnaissance analysis of the data and compile a report on the results to determine the parameters of a future model that predicts the results of the state exam in mathematics for each student in the school.

Stages of the work:

1. Primary data processing
2. Analysis and processing of data in columns
3. Correlation analysis of quantitative variables
4. Analysis of nominative variables
5. Conclusions
